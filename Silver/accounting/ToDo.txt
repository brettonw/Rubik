- split transaction implemented
- accounts should have a flag for whether or not tax is computed for the account
- tab order controlled by code
- show/hide data entry fields for the selectors
- figure out how to transfer the form fields so that changing things like show/hide preferred accounts doesn't reset the form
- transaction pane menu options ought to allow a typable box with a popup menu and autocomplete
- store the account lists, types list, and methods list in the application - update them if somebody adds new accounts, methods, etc.
- user permissions
- Some form of transaction confirmation would be good
- handle intermediate changes in transaction detail prior to actual submit, for instance use "method" change to narrow the account choices, or vice versa
- strange case where time was set wrong and was only getting old transactions from a year ago listing

Other options
- A program to retrieve account activity
- Resolve accounts from downloaded account activity
- A popup check number resolver

Completed
X tax should automatically fill as amount is typed in (or have a button to calculate it)
X bug, when editing transactions can't create a new account because the account menu is fully populated
